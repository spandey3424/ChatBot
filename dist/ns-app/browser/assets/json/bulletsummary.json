  "Question": "What additional inspection should I perform for in-depth inspection of the bearing anchor bolts",
  "Summary": 
    "As per document Rail_road_Bridge_Inspection_Manualpdf.pdf,these are the results: \nIf an inspector discovers a bridge condition that affects the integrity of the bridge under train loads, they should immediately notify the Office of Rail to halt all train traffic and arrange for immediate repairs. Bearings must be kept clean to function properly, and any debris that interferes with a bearing's movement or holds moisture around the bearing should be removed. If bearings are frozen, they can develop irregularities that cause mechanical binding and prevent movement. Cleaning rarely fixes a frozen bearing. If a large number of bearings appear to be frozen, replacement of the bearings should be considered. However, if there are no signs of distress, replacement of frozen bearings in spans less than 100 feet may not be justified.\nThe answer is refered from page number <b>{'111', '113'}</b>"
